## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your Own Copy
1. Click the "Use this template" button (or the "Start course" link in the README)
2. Create a new repository in your GitHub account
3. Wait about 20 seconds for the initial setup to complete

### Step 2: Follow the Instructions
The tutorial uses GitHub Actions to automatically update instructions:
- The current step is always shown in your repository's **README.md** file
- After completing each activity, wait ~20 seconds and refresh the page
- The README will automatically update to show the next step

## 📋 Tutorial Steps

### Current Step Indicator
The file `.github/steps/-step.txt` contains the current step number:
- `0` = Welcome
- `1` = Create a branch
- `2` = Commit a file
- `3` = Open a pull request
- `4` = Merge your pull request
- `X` = Finished!

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Create a branch** named `my-first-branch`
2. **Create a file** named `PROFILE.md` in your branch
3. **Open a pull request** to merge your changes
4. **Merge the pull request** to complete the tutorial

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Having issues? Check the **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** file for detailed solutions to common problems!

### Quick Fixes

**The README Didn't Update**
- Wait a full 20-30 seconds before refreshing
- Check the "Actions" tab to see if the workflow is still running
- Make sure you followed the instructions exactly (branch names, file names matter!)

**I Made a Mistake**
- Don't worry! You can delete your repository and start fresh
- Or, you can manually edit the `.github/steps/-step.txt` file to go back to a previous step

**GitHub Actions Aren't Running**
- Make sure GitHub Actions are enabled in your repository settings
- Check that you're not using a private repository without Actions minutes

For more detailed troubleshooting, see **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Follow instructions carefully** - Branch names and file names must match exactly
- **Wait for automation** - Give GitHub Actions time to run (usually 20-30 seconds)
- **Read the links** - Each step includes helpful documentation links
- **Take your time** - This is a learning experience, not a race!
